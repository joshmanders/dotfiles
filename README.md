# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I must use my dotfiles true.

### TODO:
Updater, watcher and syncer. Basically what these will do is automatically keep an eye on my dotfiles and any changes, or any additions to `npm`, `atom` or anything else configurable, it will update the data directory for them and then push them to the repo periodically for me. On my other machines the watchers will do the same, but also keep an eye on changes to the repo and pull them keeping all systems synced.
